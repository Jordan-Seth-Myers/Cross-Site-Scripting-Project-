# Cross-Site-Scripting-Project-
In this project, myself and other team members built a Hidden Interface Device(HID) to showcase an example of how a cross site scripting attack can happen. Also, how easy it is to create one. In this project, we encoded a teensy board with Arduino code  instructions to direct the user to a fake hacking website when the USB drive is inserted into their computer.
